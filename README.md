# FIREQ
Finite Impulse Response / Linear Phase EQ
This is based on the Haar wavelet, an orthogonal filter bank.  
The frequencies are fixed for a certian decomposition level (number of bands) and there is some overlap.

The purpose of using linear phase filters is to not cause phase distortion. 
When a solo channel in a mix is listened to with an IIR (nonlinear phase) EQ, phase differences will not be heard. 
Mixing will typically be easier with an IIR EQ because of the finer control over resonance and frequency.

One possible application of this EQ is in cabinet simulation. Many cabinets (and speakers) have transfer functions with gain curves that look very similar to the type of curves that are generated with a linear phase EQ. 

Just demo pictures...for now! Come back soon or message me if you would like to collaborate.
